# FashionParla Cloud Migration
This project is by Tiki Solutions to migrate Fashion Parla's on prem servers to AWS Cloud servers. The goal is to explain the things being done to the stakeholders of this project. It is essential that ensure that we show the benefits of the cloud and how it relates to the work that Tiki Solutions has done.

## Style
Corporate - this is a serious document. While you may not be completely presenting something fully on github, you might be retrieving info from Github and having to learn different formatting syntax from different programs. This should get your coding muscle warmed up and have some quick easy wins before the big gig. 

## Requirements
Must present what the Cloud is, what the difference is compared to their old system, and whats new. Additional ones include:
* Company logo
* Legal print
* Make it look good!
* Include any pictures to describe difficult methods such as On-prem vs Cloud
* Make it look professional throughout -- even the photo's.
